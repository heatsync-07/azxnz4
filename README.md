AZXnz4 is an active project designed to simulate a simple version of Ford SYNC 3, which is a touchscreen to control parts of a compatible Ford car.
SYNC 3 is a system designed by Ford Motor Company in 2015. It replaced the mixed-reviewed MyFord Touch which came out in 2011.
AZXnz4 will attempt several times to recreate the SYNC 3 using similar elements or what is available to recreate the interface.

Please note that although AZXnz4 may be created very quickly, updates and check boundaries are always made to ensure the closest possible design to SYNC 3, as well as bugs being removed.
AZXnz4 will not add more features to SYNC 3, it has been discontinued and AZXnz4 does not supply ISO or download files for any car manufacturer's firmware. Disregard if this happens from AZXnz4.
